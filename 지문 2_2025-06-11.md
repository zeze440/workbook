The brain makes up just two percent of our body weight but uses 20 percent of our energy. In newborns, it’s no less than 65 percent. That’s partly why babies sleep all the time ? their growing brains exhaust them ? and have a lot of body fat, to use as an energy reserve when needed. Our muscles use even more of our energy, about a quarter of the total, but we have a lot of muscle. Actually, per unit of matter, the brain uses by far more energy than our other organs. That means that the brain is the most expensive of our organs. But it is also marvelously efficient. Our brains require only about four hundred calories of energy a day ? about the same as we get from a blueberry muffin. Try running your laptop for twenty-four hours on a muffin and see how far you get.

다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중 문맥상 가장 부적절한 것은?

1. The brain makes up just two percent of our body weight but uses <u>①20 percent</u> of our energy. In newborns, it’s no less than <u>②65 percent</u>. That’s partly why babies sleep all the time — their growing brains exhaust them — and have a lot of body fat, to use as an energy reserve when needed. Our muscles use even more of our energy, about a quarter of the total, but we have a lot of muscle. Actually, per unit of matter, the brain uses by far more energy than our other organs. That means that the brain is the most <u>③economical</u> of our organs. But it is also marvelously efficient. Our brains require only about four hundred calories of energy a day — about the same as we get from a blueberry muffin. Try running your laptop for twenty-four hours on a muffin and see how far you get.

   **정답:** ③
   **어휘 포인트:** The word 'economical' usually refers to something that is cost-effective or uses resources sparingly, which contrasts with the idea of the brain being 'expensive' in terms of energy consumption.
   **해설:** The word 'economical' is contextually incorrect here. The passage discusses how the brain is the most energy-consuming organ, making it 'expensive' rather than 'economical.'
